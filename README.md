# Sketchbook

Sketchbook of various programs such as puzzles, spikes, toys,
tests, trials, or just plain fun.

After learning more than around 30 different programming languages
I stopped counting, and long before that it became about knowing
styles and paradigms of programming, such as declarative,
constraint logic, (tacit) function-level, symbolic, functional,
object-based, imperative, generic, procedural, etc.

## Euler

Some programs for <http://projecteuler.net>. So far I have been
using mostly COBOL for fun, but they can be in any programming
language, i.e. Prolog, APL, AWK, or Standard ML.

## Programming Praxis

Programming for fun, there are a lot of interesting problems at
<http://programmingpraxis.com> mostly of numerical, algorithmic,
constraint, and logic kind, but there are also other kinds of
fun problems.
