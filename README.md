# Sketchbook

Sketchbook of various programs such as puzzles, spikes, toys,
tests, trials, or just plain fun.

After learning more than around 2 different programming languages
I stopped counting, and long before that it became about knowing
styles and paradigms of programming, such as declarative,
constraint logic, (tacit) function-level, symbolic, functional,
object-based, imperative, generic, procedural, etc.

Just about every opinion about a programming language I have
ever read on the web is just plain wrong. After learning enough
Lisp, Forth (ColorForth), Smalltalk, J, and APL, it occured to
me after looking at standard Java program texts that if people
were this wrong about Lisp and so forth then perhaps people
were also wrong about the hated programming language COBOL. I
bought a couple of books, read one online, and read through
the [FAQ][]s and online tutorials ([Limerick][])
I could find, and of course discovered that COBOL is not that
bad and has a lot going for it.

To quote Chuck Moore: "All programming languages are write-only."

## Euler

Some programs for <http://projecteuler.net>. So far I have been
using mostly COBOL for fun, but they can be in any programming
language, i.e. Prolog, APL, AWK, or StandardML.

## Programming Praxis

Programming for fun, there are a lot of interesting problems at
<http://programmingpraxis.com> mostly of numerical, algorithmic,
constraint, and logic kind, but there are also other kinds of
fun problems.
