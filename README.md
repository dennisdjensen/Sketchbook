# Sketchbook

Sketchbook of various programs such as puzzles, spikes, toys,
tests, trials, or just plain fun.

After learning more than around 2 different programming languages
I stopped counting, and long before that it became about knowing
styles and paradigms of programming, such as declarative,
constraint logic, (tacit) function-level, symbolic, functional,
object-based, imperative, generic, procedural, etc.

Just about every opinion about a programming language I have
ever read on the web is just plain wrong. Worse, people speak
about things they do not know about.

To quote Chuck Moore: "All programming languages are write-only."

After learning enough Lisp, Forth (ColorForth), Smalltalk,
Fortran, J, and APL, it occured to me after looking at standard
Java program texts that if people were this wrong about Lisp
and other so-called niche languages then perhaps they were
also wrong about the despised programming language COBOL. I
bought a couple of books, read Gary Cutler's fantastic online
[guide](Garys-guide), and read through the [FAQ][]s and
online tutorials ([Limerick][]) I could find, and of course
discovered that not only is COBOL not bad, but quite good with
its own quirkyness, especially when you take into account its
age. I even heard about people using embedded COBOL programming
with good reason.

It's fun to notice that very different languages such as Ada,
Lisp, and COBOL have things in common, such as being verbal,
i.e. you have to read the programs in order to understand
them, because there is very little semantic information in the
visual form.

## Euler

Some programs for <http://projecteuler.net>. So far I have been
using mostly COBOL for fun, but they can be in any programming
language, i.e. Prolog, APL, AWK, or StandardML.

## Programming Praxis

Programming for fun, there are a lot of interesting problems at
<http://programmingpraxis.com> mostly of numerical, algorithmic,
constraint, and logic kind, but there are also other kinds of
fun problems.
