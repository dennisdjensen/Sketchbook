# Sketchbook

Sketchbook of various programs such as puzzles, spikes, toys,
tests, or just plain fun.

## Euler

Some of my programs for <http://projecteuler.net>. So far I have
been using mostly COBOL for fun, but they can be any programming
language, i.e. Prolog, APL, AWK, or StandardML.

## Programming Praxis

Programming for fun, there are a lot of interesting problems at
<http://programmingpraxis.com> mostly of numerical, algorithmic,
constraint, and logic kind, but there are also other fun small
toy problems.
